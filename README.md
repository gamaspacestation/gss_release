# GSS Release

This is the source code of GAMA Space Station, made fully open source under the MIT license.

### Building

The source code depends on Unreal Engine 5.2.1, which can be downloaded from the Epic Games Launcher.

Once you have the engine installed, you can open the project by double clicking on the `GSS.uproject` file. 

If you have a different version of the engine installed, you can right click on the `GSS.uproject` file and select `Switch Unreal Engine Version` to select the version you want to use.

Alternatively, you could also build the project with Visual Studio by right clicking on the `GSS.uproject` file and selecting `Generate Visual Studio project files`. This will generate a Visual Studio solution file that you can open and build the project from.

### Quantum Engine AI Integration

Optionally, you may modify the GSS source code to integrate the Quantum Engine AI: we have provided a fully open API for you to use. The API is flexible and project agnostic, so we have preloaded the API with example NPC behaviors from Cyberpunk 2077. You can find the API specification under `api.yml`.
